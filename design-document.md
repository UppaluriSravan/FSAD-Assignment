# Book Exchange Platform Design Document

## Overview

This application is a platform where users can create a list of books available for exchange. Users can log in, log out, update book details, and delete books.

## Features

1. **User Authentication**

   - Users can register, log in, and log out.
   - Secure password storage and authentication.

2. **Book Management**
   - Users can add books to their exchange list.
   - Users can update details of books they have added.
   - Users can delete books from their list.

## User Stories

1. **User Registration and Login**

   - As a user, I want to register an account so that I can log in to the platform.
   - As a user, I want to log in to my account so that I can manage my book list.
   - As a user, I want to log out of my account to ensure my data is secure.

2. **Managing Books**
   - As a user, I want to add books to my list so that others can see what I have available for exchange.
   - As a user, I want to update the details of my books so that the information is accurate.
   - As a user, I want to delete books from my list if they are no longer available for exchange.

## System Architecture

1. **Frontend**

   - Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
   - Framework: React (or any other preferred framework).

2. **Backend**

   - Developed using Node.js and Express.
   - RESTful API for communication with the frontend.

3. **Database**
   - MongoDB for storing user and book data.

## API Endpoints

1. **User Authentication**

   - `POST /api/register`: Register a new user.
   - `POST /api/login`: Log in a user.
   - `POST /api/logout`: Log out a user.

2. **Book Management**
   - `GET /api/books`: Get a list of books.
   - `POST /api/books`: Add a new book.
   - `PUT /api/books/:id`: Update book details.
   - `DELETE /api/books/:id`: Delete a book.

## Security Considerations

- Use HTTPS for secure communication.
- Implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication.
- Validate all inputs to prevent SQL injection and other attacks.

## Conclusion

This document outlines the design of a book exchange platform, detailing the features, user stories, system architecture, API endpoints, and security considerations. This platform will allow users to manage their book exchange lists efficiently and securely.
